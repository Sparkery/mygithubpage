<center><h3>Welcome!</h3>
<p>TJ Smash #2 strives to start a competitive Smash Bros. scene at Thomas Jefferson High School.</p>
<p>If you are a recent alumnus or a current student, you are able to play!</p>
<p><b>Saturday, November 28. Location and Timing TBD.</b></p>

<h3>Why Do We Need A Smash Tournment?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Community! <p class="ind">We realize school is stressful, and nothing helps with that more than a community of gamer friends.</p>
    <li>Reputation! <p class="ind">Who doesn't like to be known as the God of Smash at their high school?
    <li>Service Hours! <p class="ind"> I, Fox, will sign off NHS hours for anyone who helps run the event. <i>Confirmed by NHS!</i>
    <li>Fun! <p class="ind">Smash is always a great way to pass time, especially on those weekends you don't have anything to do.</p>
</ul>
