<br />
<p>Pizza is also FREE, but it is highly recommended to bring some money to be nice :)</p>
<p>Also, WE NEED SETUPS. Bring your laptop and adapter, huge TVs, and Wii's.

<h4>Ruleset</h4>
<p>Singles</p>
<ul>
  <li>Timer is 6 minutes for Brawl, 8 minutes for Project M.
  <li>Brawl has 2 stocks. Project M has 4 stocks.
  <li>Regular Singles rules. Stage list coming soon.
  <li>All sets are Best Of 5.
  <li>Still thinking about how the bracket will look.
  <li>Meta Knight is legal (Brawl). Ice Climbers cannot chaingrab (Brawl).
</ul>
<p>Ironman Doubles</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is no timer.</li>
  <li>Brawl has 2 stocks. Project M has 4 stocks.
  <li>Decide with your teammate the "8 character pool" you will both use.
  <ul>
    <li>Switch characters when all your stocks are depleted.
    <li>Forfeit lost stocks at the start of each game.
    <li>The winning team is the team to defeat all 8 of the opponent's characters.
    <li>If one team member runs out of stocks completely, they may share characters.
  </ul>
  <li>Still thinking about how the bracket will look.
  <li>Double Meta Knight is illegal (Brawl).
  <li>You shouldn't be able to use the same character twice in your pool, but I don't know yet.
  <li>Example of how this all works (with "4 character pools" for simplicity). My teammate and I agreed on Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Bowser (Brawl). I play Bowser and my teammate plays Peach. Since nobody is good at Peach, he loses both stocks while I lose 1 stock. The next game, he goes Mario and I forfeit one of my Bowser stocks at the start. Peach is out. I lose my second Bowser stock and my trash teammate loses both his Mario stocks. We would both normally choose two new characters, but because only Luigi remains, we have the special option to split his stocks evenly. Since we both misfire off stage and we ran out of characters, we lost the Ironman Match.
</ul>
