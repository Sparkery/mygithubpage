<h4>This is a SINGLES and IRONMAN DOUBLES Melee and Brawl event.</h4>

<h4>Entry Fee</h4>
<p>Entering for one game gives you access to both of its events.</p>
<p>Melee - FREE</p>
<p>Brawl - FREE</p>
<br />
<p>Pizza is also FREE, but it is highly recommended to bring some money to be nice :)</p>
<p>Also, WE NEED SETUPS. Bring your laptop and adapter, huge TVs, and Wii's.

<h4>Ruleset</h4>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
  <li>No items. Though I might allow them as a counterpick :)
  <li>No stalling, intentional glitching, or anything that the community deems indecent. Just don't be the archetypal "that guy."
  <li>Seeding will be used in this tournament. We've had enough to know who we don't want to play in round 1 losers.
  <li>Advanced techniques such as wavedashing and edge-cancelling are allowed. I think we're past the days of Nihar's first tournament where Richard had to actually specify this, but just to be sure!
</ul>
<p>Singles</p>
<ul>
  <li>Timer is 6 minutes for Brawl, 8 minutes for Melee.
  <li>Brawl has 2 stocks. Melee has 4 stocks.
  <li>Regular Singles rules. Stage list coming soon.
  <li>All sets are Best Of 5.
  <li>Still thinking about how the bracket will look. Expect pools to decide who starts in winners and losers.
  <li>Meta Knight is legal (Brawl). Fox is legal (Melee). Ice Climbers cannot chaingrab (Brawl) but can wobble (Melee).
  <li>If you don't have a main character, you're allowed to go random. I might do this myself!
</ul>
<p>Ironman Doubles</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is no timer.</li>
  <li>Brawl has 2 stocks. Melee has 4 stocks.
  <li>Decide with your teammate the "8 character pool" you will both use.
  <ul>
    <li>Switch characters when all your stocks are depleted.
    <li>Forfeit lost stocks at the start of each game.
    <li>The winning team is the team to defeat all 8 of the opponent's characters.
    <li>If only one character remains, teammates may agree to split their stocks equally.
  </ul>
  <li>Still thinking about how the bracket will look.
  <li>Double Meta Knight is illegal (Brawl).
  <li>You shouldn't be able to use the same character twice in your pool (ex. two Foxes, Falco, two Wolves, etc.) I'm looking for character diversity, since everyone plays Marth and Game and Watch.
  <li>Example of how this all works (with "4 character pools" for simplicity). My teammate and I agreed on Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Bowser (Brawl). I play Bowser and my teammate plays Peach. Since nobody is good at Peach, he loses both stocks while I lose 1 stock. The next game, he goes Mario and I forfeit one of my Bowser stocks at the start. Peach is out. I lose my second Bowser stock and my trash teammate loses both his Mario stocks. We would both normally choose two new characters, but because only Luigi remains, we have the special option to split his stocks evenly. Since we both misfire off stage and we ran out of characters, we lost the Ironman Match.
  <li>If there's a dispute in Ironman rules, since I know I'm not explaining this well: unless it's a serious concern, I'm going to say "yes".
 <li>If you have a teammate preference, let me know! Otherwise, I'll try to make as fair teams as I can. I'll let you all know a few days in advance so you two can start to prepare losing to a Zelda and Snake.
 </ul>

<h4>Who I'm Playing (in Ironmans)</h4>
<p>This is not a high-stakes competitive event! It's more of having fun. We'll leave the high-APM gameplay to Peter and Asa.</p>
<p>Also, everyone is going high tiers anyway, so here it goes!
